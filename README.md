## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Firebase Setup

1.  **Create a Firebase Project**: Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project (or use an existing one).
2.  **Add a Web App**: In your Firebase project settings, add a new Web App and copy the Firebase configuration object.
3.  **Enable Firebase Services**:
    *   **Authentication**: Enable "Email/Password" and "Google" sign-in methods. Set a "Project support email" for Google Sign-In.
    *   **Firestore**: Create a Firestore database in Native mode.
    *   **Storage**: Set up Firebase Storage.
4.  **Environment Variables**:
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project.
    *   Add your Firebase configuration details to this file:
        ```env
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
        ```
    *   The application has fallback values in `src/firebase/config.ts` but using `.env.local` is strongly recommended.
5.  **Security Rules**:
    *   **Firestore**: Secure your data by setting up Firestore security rules. A basic example to allow users to access only their own scripts:
        ```json
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            match /users/{userId}/scripts/{scriptId} {
              allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
              match /versions/{versionId} {
                allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    *   **Storage**: Secure your file uploads (e.g., profile pictures) with Storage security rules:
        ```
        rules_version = '2';
        service firebase.storage {
          match /b/{bucket}/o {
            match /profilePictures/{userId}/{fileName} {
              allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
              allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId
                           && request.resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024 // Max 5MB
                           && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/(jpeg|png|gif|webp)');
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    *   Deploy these rules via the Firebase console or Firebase CLI.

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or use within Firebase Studio.**
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server for the Next.js app**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The app will usually be available at `http://localhost:9002` (or another port if 9002 is busy).

4.  **Run the Genkit development server (for AI features)**:
    Open a new terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    # or
    npm run genkit:watch # for auto-reloading on Genkit flow changes
    ```
    This typically starts on `http://localhost:3400`.

## Key Functionalities

### Script Management
Access the Script Manager via the "Scripts" button in the header. Here you can:
*   Create new scripts or edit existing ones in a text area.
*   Save scripts with a name. Logged-in users' scripts sync to Firestore; anonymous users' scripts save to browser local storage.
*   Load saved scripts into the teleprompter.
*   Rename, duplicate, or delete scripts.
*   Import scripts from `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf`, and `.docx` files.
*   Export the current script as a `.txt` file.
*   Save and load different versions of a script, with optional notes for each version.
*   Generate an AI-powered summary of the current script.

### Teleprompter Controls & Settings
*   **Playback Bar**: Located at the bottom (hidden in Presentation Mode). Controls play/pause, reset, AI Sync toggle, script summary, fullscreen, and presentation mode.
*   **Settings Panel**: Access via the gear icon in the header. Customize:
    *   **Appearance**: Font size, line spacing, font family, text color, horizontal text padding, focus line position and style (line or shaded paragraph), mirror mode, dark/light/high-contrast themes.
    *   **Playback**: Scroll speed, AI scroll sync (enable/disable), countdown timer (enable/disable, duration).
    *   **Layouts & Profiles**: Apply predefined layout presets or save/load your custom combinations of settings as named profiles.
    *   **General**: Reset core settings to defaults.

### Authentication
*   Users can sign up with an email and password, or sign in using Google.
*   Password reset functionality is available.
*   Logged-in users can update their display name and profile picture.

### AI Features
*   **Script Summary**: Get a concise summary of the current script text using Genkit.
*   **AI Scroll Sync (Experimental)**: When enabled in settings and activated via the playback controls, the application will attempt to listen to your speech and adjust the teleprompter scroll speed accordingly. (Note: The speech analysis part is currently a placeholder).

## üé® Styling & Theming

*   The application uses Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
*   It supports **Light Mode**, **Dark Mode**, and a **High-Contrast Mode** for accessibility. Theme preferences are persisted.
*   The primary color is a calming light blue (`#5DADE2`), with a light grey background (`#F0F4F8`) and a desaturated purple accent (`#A992E2`).
*   The main font is 'Inter', with 'Atkinson Hyperlegible' available as a high-readability option.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

*   **Spacebar / Backspace**: Toggle Play/Pause scrolling (when not focused on an input field).
*   **Esc**: Exit Fullscreen or Presentation mode.
*   **Ctrl+S / Cmd+S**: Save current script (when Script Manager is open and focused).

## üîÆ Known Issues / Future Enhancements

*   **AI Scroll Sync**: The speech analysis component of AI Scroll Sync is currently a placeholder and does not perform actual speech-to-speed calculations. This requires integration with a Speech-to-Text API.
*   **Advanced Rich Text Editing**: While basic markdown and cues are supported, a full WYSIWYG editor for scripts could be a future enhancement.
*   **File Import Robustness**: Further enhance parsing and error handling for imported files, especially complex PDFs or DOCX.
*   **Tags/Folders for Scripts**: Organization features for users with many scripts.
*   **Advanced AI Script Tools**: Grammar checks, tone adjustment, or rephrasing suggestions.
*   **HTML File Import**: Support for importing HTML files with proper sanitization.
*   **Debounce Script Input**: For very large scripts, debounce text area input to improve performance.
*   **Draft Auto-Save**: Periodically auto-save script drafts to local storage for recovery.
